## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial process for retail businesses. By clustering customers based on their purchasing behaviors, retailers can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and boost sales.

This project demonstrates the use of the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm** to group customers based on features like their annual spending, frequency of purchases, and items purchased.

## Dataset
The sample dataset provided contains information about the customers' annual spending, frequency of purchases, and items purchased.

| CustomerID | Annual_Spending | Frequency_of_Purchase | Items_Purchased |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 101        | 5000            | 12                    | 25              |
| 102        | 15000           | 50                    | 100             |
| 103        | 7000            | 20                    | 35              |
| 104        | 12000           | 40                    | 80              |
| 105        | 8000            | 25                    | 45              |

Download the dataset: [purchase_history.csv](./purchase_history.csv)

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Make sure the dataset (`purchase_history.csv`) is in the root directory.
   
2. Run the `kmeans_clustering.py` script to apply the K-Means algorithm and generate clusters:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```

3. The script will output a CSV file `clustered_customers.csv` containing the original dataset along with the cluster each customer belongs to.

## Results
The result will be a CSV file with an additional `Cluster` column that shows which cluster each customer belongs to. You can visualize these clusters using the provided `matplotlib` code in the script.

Example:

| CustomerID | Annual_Spending | Frequency_of_Purchase | Items_Purchased | Cluster |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 101        | 5000            | 12                    | 25              | 2       |
| 102        | 15000           | 50                    | 100             | 0       |
| 103        | 7000            | 20                    | 35              | 2       |
